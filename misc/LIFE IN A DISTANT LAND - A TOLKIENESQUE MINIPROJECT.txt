GIVEN NAME			SURNAME				MADE NAME				EPITHET
Hîoreis            Boreâûlod		   Umnisolcanê	           Aitermesas		

A person's name is very important in their culture. It is a reflection of the love for whom one's parents bear, the person's achivements and their everlasting legacy, if granted by fortune.

The proper way to refer to Aitermesas is Lodbes Boreâûlod Umnisolcanê Aitermesas,
which roughly translates to His Majesty, of the line of Boreâûlod, made at Umnisolcanê, Light of the East. 
In his younger days, he was often referred to as Boreâûlod Umnisolcanê ter Heroîne-Tanohas Dolaî (the Elder, to differentiate him from his brother Mordaneis Mesdeâdanor, the Sandstorm).

In addition, Heroîne-Tanohasî can also be added at the end, since his place of birth is Heroîne-Tanohas. 

To be made is to be recognize by people (usually a host or an army, but a crowd is most common), for the first time in a person's life as a man. Two men with the same made name are considered brothers bounded by glory.

Sadly, their culture is still misogynistic, although change is on the horizon. But for now, that means a woman's name is limited to her given, surname and occasionally place of birth.

=== *** rules *** ===

(+) GROUND RULES: Most solo words are nouns, KISS. Pronuncitation is to be determined, however, it is certain that dialects and patois exist. To KISS, every idiosyncratic version encountered is 
                  a legitimate dialect/patois/accent. The special compound consonant of "hng" is the only constant, if used, and its pronunciation is a fast "âng". 
                  Double Ts are sometimes English light "th", especially in the standard accent. "H" before a "hatted-vowel" is a soft "kh", and the "hatted-vowel" is stressed.

(+) NOUNS: 
    - Plurals are created with the addition of "l". "LL", in the standard form of their language, is pronounced like the Welsh double ls, but less harsh. Possesives are created with the addition of "tta".

(+) VERBS:
    - Verbs are created with the addition of "eis", with "eis" itself meaning action. Thus, to act is "eiseis"

(+) ADJECTIVES:
    - Adjectives are created with the addition of "î", which indicates that the sound is pronounced separatedly. Always come before nouns. Multiple adjectives need not be ordered when combined with nouns, however, whatever comes
      first is considered the center of the conversation. Compound adjectives do not exist in the standard version of their language, but can be found in others, and considered as an "uneducated" use of language.

(+) ADVERBS:
    - As per the principle of KISS, an adverb is, in its simplest form, an adjective with the addition of the verb-indicating suffix. Always come after verbs.

(+) PREPOSITIONS:
    - Some rare words that are not nouns belong in this category. Some are combined with nouns to create compound prepositions, which is more specific and accurate than normal prepositions.
